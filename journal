The purpose of this document is to record progress and work done towards the Cordyceps Militaris project.
The README doc is more for descriptions and TODO's, so this will be event based records.

Not much to say besides I have an essential shell or skeleton of the C2. 
The CLI is starting to really come along.
Last major improvement was that of adding Beaconing.
With this, we have a simple ping relay which returns up ordown depending on the return value of the system ping command.
The other function of the function then will send a 'beacon' signal to the rat to see if the connection is still valid and active.
The main issue I see here is the cross contaminating of tunnels and streams, and may require a seperate 'manager/beacon' socket to be created for it as to not mix the comm channels.
I'll have to read more on how this works. 

Update:
Decided to use a 'wait' variable in the handler so that way if the user is currently interacting with the shell/client/rat then it will not beacon through the socket.
Debating on whether to do the same thing with the ping records as well, but that may be useful in recording uptime (over long periods? useful?? :D ).

This may be the init of profiles and the logging associated.
Have to check how permissions are handed out on linux systems to see if we can just put them in /var/log/ or if we should create our own directory for it.

Profiles:
I think that the right idea would be to use JSON for basic profile compilation. 
For example, the JSON would list the IP, Port, OS, currentDir, Modules activated, etc.

Logs:
Logs would not need to be edited, and therefore can be simple txt files.
With this, there should be a set of logs for each Profile/RAT that joins, or to make things aggregated and simpler we could simply put all the information in one log, with rotation.
I don't really see a difference besides a secondary layer of parsing (with the aggregated file). 
Could make the info easier to find too if it was in it's own seperate directory/location. 

Not 100% sure.

So I've decided that profiling and the associated logging will be the next thing to tackle.
Shouldnt be too terrible, just a bunch of writing to files and ensuring that there isn't any memory being access by multiple threads.
Lets start by outlining what we want from each of the ideas.

In order to have a valid profile, we need to discern what makes a connection special across multiple instannces and uses of the C2.
I think these include:
	- IP Address
	- Client Port
	- Current Working Directory
	- base64 ID (Different for each rat instance when it starts) -  more or less RNG? See below...

(Quick thought) What if on every startip of a RAT is self assigns it's own hexdecimal or base64 id?
This would ensure that just because the RAT gets disconnected from the C2 the actual information retrieved from the RAT will not be seperate from the earlier instance.
With this, I think we can also expand on the 'sleep' function, which can put the RAT in a non-active state, while maintaining it's id and information. 
Maybe we could have the C2 assign this and keep track of them. As in, when a client connects we assign them an ID then create their profile in the 'profiles' dir. 
Then, as more and more clients connect the Directory grows with IDs.

In contrast this could get out of hand... The idea of using IDs is alright, but how will the RATs know what ID it is? Do they need to know? What if the RAT gets disconnected completely.
Would it be simpler to have the C2 organize by IP address and just seperate the connections by timestamps and Client ports? Will definitely need to think about this more.
Also, if that is the road to take (storage by IP address) than something tells me I'm gonna need somewhat of a better storage allocation that a simple txt. 
I could be wrong though. Simple aggregated logging might just do that trick.

So JSON is totally off the table I think. If anything, a CSV would be a better option for storage of information, or even a txt with line association.
Reading online it seems like the format is most definitly not meant to be updated often with information, which is what were looking to do (i think).
With that, logging is the focus and priority for the next week. Going to outline a structure here:

server.log:
 - STATUS
 - ERROR

listener.log:
 - STATUS
 - INIT-CONNECTION
 - DISCONNECTION
 - ERROR

interpreter.log:
 - STATUS
 - MODE-INIT
 - MODE-EXIT
 - CMD
  - History...
 - ERROR

handler.log
 - STATUS
 - INIT-CONNECTION
 - DISCONNECTION
 - SHELL ENTRY/EXIT
 - CMDs

beacon.log = for all clients and connections (timeline)
 - UPTIME (Ping)
 - BEACON
 - ERROR

I've made the decision to implement the logger into an object itself.
This will allow easier management as it's own (writing and reading) thread.

There will simply be three log files: One for all C2 Related errors and messages, and one for all uptime related errors and messages, and one for all server-side connection issues.

The class/object has been created, the next job is to figure out how the hell the logging queues will be implemented. 

20210109 - Saturday 17:00
I'm torn between implementing the logging functions as threads in the server.py file, or having the logger be it's own object, with it's own logging functions for each of the 3 logs, or have a seperate object for each log itself.

Backstreets back y'all, PvJ work had taken over my life for a few weeks and now that the bulk of it is over the development on this bad boy continues.
So last I remember I was trying to figure out how to implement the logging with the logger object and avoiding race conditions. 
I want to do this with queues, but how? 
Initial thought says creating a log() function in the object that retrieves the job from the queue, opens the correct log, writes, closes, and returns success or error.
This will mean that it has to have it's own thread (check), continually monitor the queue for updates (not yet), and process so a race conditition does not ensue.

With this, I'm a little confused on how to pass information within the queue beings that there are different types of messages. 
A few ideas pop to mind:
 - Instead of passing a string to the log() function, pass a tuple that includes the log being written to and the message itself.
 - Pass a string with the first part (between the first delimeter of choice) being the log type, ie."[server] msg" and have the function parse the first section of the string

I'm thinking that I simply just pass a tuple object as a parameter. So the structure is as follows:

{ LOGTYPE, MSG}    < Part of me feels that this could be expanded based on other information we would want to throw to the function with the log, but I'm not sure right now.

Other than the topic of logging development, we had our first major (and productive) meeting on Monday. Currently the work structure is as follows:
 - Andrew is working on the DNS transport schema to incorporate it into the C2 as a possible communication mechanism
 - Dalton is doing the same thing with the HTTP and HTTPs side of things. 
 - I am currently working on the logging system and the CMD History element, then moving forward unto cleaning up the UI and C2 structure itself. 

I have a good feeling about this semester.
I think we're going to get a lot done, and produce something that is not only useful to the world and our successors but beautiful in it's own right and makes us proud to have worked on it.
